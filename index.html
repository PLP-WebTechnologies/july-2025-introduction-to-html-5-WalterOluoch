            <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
            <p>Bouldering is a type of rock climbing done without ropes or harnesses, typically on short walls or natural rock formations that are around 3 to 5 meters (10 to 15 feet) high. To stay safe, climbers use thick crash pads on the ground and often have spotters nearby.</p>
            <h2>Why should you try bouldering?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Full body workout</li>
                <li>Mental challenge</li>
                <li>No bulky gear needed</li>
                <li>Quick progress</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What do you need to start bouldering</h2>
            <p>Getting started with bouldering is easy and doesn’t require much—just a pair of climbing shoes, some chalk to keep your hands dry, and comfortable clothes that let you move freely. If you’re climbing outdoors, you’ll also need a crash pad for safety, but indoor gyms usually have padded floors already. Bring some water, a snack, and most importantly, a positive mindset—falling is part of the learning process. Whether you go solo or with a friend, bouldering is all about challenging yourself and having fun while doing it.</p>
